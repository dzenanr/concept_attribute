Let's take an example. I have a Member model :

    def change
        create_table :members do |t|
            t.string :a
            t.string :b
        end
    end
end
I realize later that a Member has a Car. So, I have to create the Car model etc ... Now, I have to modify both models adding belong_to and has_one rules but also create a new migration and add car.integer :member_id

I find it pretty unpractical and redundant. Is there any trick letting do this automatically ? Furthermore, unlike Symfony2 where model are totally dissociated from the database, here we need to inform a foreign_key column. Is there any way to write something like car.member :member instead of car.integer :member_id ? It is a detail, but I would appreciate.

Thanks :)"""},

{"text" : """I have a domain model in which each line item is associated with a product. The product has a list of options. Each option is either required or optional. The user can include an optional option which will add it to the line item's selections list.

In order to avoid redundancy, my first thought was to exclude required options from the line item's selections list. There are a lot of required options, so including them for every line item would lead to a bloated database.

The problem is that the products can potentially change over time. Options that were once required could become optional, and visa-versa. And entirely new options may be added to the product. This creates a problem with my initial idea, since the meaning of line items' selection lists would depend on a product's options at the time of the order.

So what should I do?

If I also include required options in the line item's selection lists, then the model is simple. I'd have a snapshot of the options that were included with the product. But then I've also got a lot of bloat in the database since references to required options will be repeated for every line item. Is this something I should be worried about or will SQL Server do some kind of behind-the-scenes compression?

Should I pursue my original idea of excluding required options from the line item's selection lists? Then I would need to keep some historical data regarding changes to the products. That way I could recreate the product and its options as they existed at the time of the order. Sounds possible but more complicated than the first option. I worry it would take more CPU cycles but that would be okay if its for old orders which won't be opened very often. I've never had to do this myself before, but maybe it wouldn't be so hard. If this is the approach you recommend, please provide some pointers to design patterns, etc. to help me get started."""},
